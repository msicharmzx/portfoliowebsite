                In Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, two teams of five players each engage in
                intense battles to destroy the enemy’s base while defending their own.
                The game features a variety of heroes classified into different roles
                such as Tanks, Mages, Assassins, Marksmen, Supports, and Fighters.
                Players must work together, strategize, and leverage their heroes'
                strengths to achieve victory.

            <p>
                <i>To ascend to the status of a hero, one must embark upon a journey
                    of self-discovery and introspection, for a profound understanding of
                    oneself lays the foundation for extraordinary achievements.</i>
