            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>
                You’ve just downloaded Mobile Legends and instantly felt like this
                game will take up quite a lot of your time. I know how you feel, I’ve
                been there myself. As someone who plays MOBAs quite a lot, I feel like
                there are too many unwritten rules to these games, which players often
                overlook, don’t pay attention to, or simply don’t know about, until
                way later on. Since I always thought it would be nice to have an easy
                way to understand these “obscure” mechanics, I’ve put together this
                Mobile Legends guide, where I will share all the beginner tips and
                tricks that you need to know about. Everything you learn here should
                help you get started on the right foot, and with a clear understanding
                of the game.
            </p>

            <h2>Mobile Legends: What is the game’s objective?</h2>

            <p>
                The game’s mechanics are quite simple: you need to take down the enemy
                Crystal, which is located at the core of the enemy’s base. To reach
                this, your team will have to kill enemy outer turrets (the turrets
                closest to the middle of the map), inner turrets (the second turrets
                you encounter, closer to the base), and finally, base turrets (the
                turrets located in the base, right before the Crystal) to open the
                base. Each team will be able to choose a role, which is assigned to a
                lane (or to the jungle/roaming/ganking). Very early on in the game,
                most people will not stick to their roles and move chaotically. That’s
                fine until you rank up and start playing with more knowledgeable
                players. Roles will impact the game a lot more in these stages.
            </p>

            <h2>What heroes I should play in Mobile Legends?</h2>

            <p>
                You’re just at the start, but you want to have a good one. So, you
                should start by learning the skills of the heroes you own and try to
                practice playing them in their assigned roles. You should then save
                some currency to unlock some of the meta heroes, which are strong in
                the current patch/season. You should take a look at our tier list to
                learn who they are. Playing a random hero until you can afford one of
                the “meta” heroes is fine because you will be able to adapt to the
                game, and better understand how it works (and when you should and
                shouldn’t fight). Also, if you don't know what class you should play
                yet, try playing a hero from each role and see which one fits you the
                best.
            </p>

            <h2>How do I play?</h2>
            <p>
                You will start in the base - there you’ll have to purchase items from
                the top right corner of the screen, then move to your designated lane
                (you will see an arrow pointing you towards the lane). In lane, you
                should try to kill creeps to gain EXP, and use the Gold they drop to
                buy more items and upgrade your existing ones. When you have a wave
                pushing towards the enemy tower, let the minions take aggro from the
                tower and then attack it. If you want to have a better understanding
                of each role, you should check our roles guide, where I've broken down
                each role, and explained in great detail how to position accordingly
                and much more!
            </p>

            <h2>How do I win at Mobile Legends?</h2>
            <p>
                Winning can be achieved by destroying the enemy Crystal. Sometimes it
                will take some time because you might have to siege every tower and
                have all the lanes pushing. If you find yourself in a difficult game
                (a.k.a. “unwinnable game”), take a step back and assess the situation.
                - See if there is anything you could to do help your team shut down
                the enemy team, and take the chance. - Farm more, try to get more Gold
                and EXP, and catch up with the enemies - Try to kill the jungle
                monsters for even more EXP, Gold, and buffs - Pull together your team
                and try to fight together, not 1 by 1
