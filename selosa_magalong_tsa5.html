            <p class="description">Lunox was born with magical powers, and her dreamworld reflects and changes the real
                world. With this power, she uses her dreamworld to temporarily maintain the balance of energy between
                order and chaos. But as the power of order and the power of chaos rushed into her dreams, Lunox fell
                into a long sleep and turned into one of the "Twilight Orbs". As the final battle started, the Twillight
                Orb devoured the energies within the Mage and opened, from which stepped out a girl, who was surrounded
                by the power of Chaos and Order. Her eyes are deep as the ancient lake.

                The mysterious atmosphere she created then put all of the heroes into dreamland… The power of Chaos and
                Order have been struggling against each other since the ancient time, and the struggle had driven the
                world into desperation. Lunox, the mysterious maiden, is the one who survived the desperation. With her
                unique talent, she can project her dream into reality and change it.</p>

            <p class="description">Once a sworn knight of Ridgeburg, Leomord was forced to shatter the oath he made with
                his own sword in an unfortunate turn of events. Since then, he had borne the curse of the Mist and
                guarded the land abandoned even by death. The light had faded, yet his watch had just begun… A hundred
                years had passed, yet time in Ridgeburg seemed to have frozen in place. Shrouded by heavy, dark fog, the
                city was known to be cursed, shunned by both the light and the dark. Necrokeep, they called it.</p>

            <p class="description">Since Karrie was young, she was truly gifted and went through cruel training to
                become an excellent, but arrogant warrior leader. However at the same time, she had also become void of
                all emotions and had almost turned into a machine. One time, she was too overconfident in battle and
                this resulted in her becoming, seriously injured. A prophet from another race saved her and injected his
                consciousness into her brain. Since then, a voice had been echoing within her head, revealing to her
                that the end of the Yasson empire was imminent and the race would soon become extinct. Still dazed from
                this near-death experience, Karrie couldn’t believe it. But she started to suspect the prophecy after
                returning to her empire.. Finally, Karrie decided to change the future and went into the Land of Dawn.

            <p class="description">In olden times, there was once a state named Minoa in Agelta Drylands. The prince in
                the state, Minotaur fatally injured his father in a fit of rage, after which he exiled himself to the
                Minoan Labyrinth in shame and regret.Consumed by shame and regret, Minotaur headed to the Minoan
                Labyrinth-the burial ground of the Minoan ancestors-and began his training and repentance.

                Over time, Minotaur gradually gained control over his rage and became able to tap into his raging powers
                at will.

                As Minotaur thrust himself into this arduous training, an unexpected catastrophe struck. The entire
                Minoa. was flattened by the explosion of the Twilight Orb, and only Minotaur was left unharmed under the
                protection of the Labyrinth. Minotaur rushed toward the state amidst the tremors, wanting to find out
                what had happened, when a broken piece from the Twilight Orb plummeted into the Labyrinth and sealed it
                whole. Minotaur, who was half a step out of the Labyrinth, was sealed altogether and put into a deep
                slumber.</p>
